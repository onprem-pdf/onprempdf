# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in OnPremPDF,
please report it responsibly by contacting:

info@onprempdf.com

Please do not disclose security issues publicly before we have had a chance
to investigate and address them.

## Response Process
We aim to acknowledge security reports within 2 business days and provide
an initial assessment within 5 business days.


## Dependency Security

OnPremPDF uses a small, well-defined set of third-party libraries.
JSON input is deserialized into fixed internal data models without
polymorphic or dynamic type handling.

Dependencies are reviewed periodically and updated in response to
relevant security advisories.

## Scope
This security policy applies to:
- The OnPremPDF application
- Official installation scripts and documentation

It does not apply to customer infrastructure, network configuration,
or third-party software not distributed by OnPremPDF.
